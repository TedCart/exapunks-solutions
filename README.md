# WORK IN PROGRESS

These are my solutions for the puzzles in Zachtronics' excellent puzzle-game **EXAPUNKS**.

Solutions are "graded," if you will, on 3 criteria:
- Cycles
- Size
- Activity

**Cycles** is the number of cycles it takes your code to complete the task. It's how fast your code is. The fewer the cycles, the faster the code.

**Size** is how many lines of code you used, not counting comments or blank lines.

**Activity** is how many times your EXAs moved from one host to another (e.g. Every `LINK 800` adds one to your `Activity`).

For every challenge in EXAPUNKS there are optimal scores for Cycles, Size, and Activity. As difficulty increases, you often need to choose which of those three you are going to optimize as focusing on one can adversely affect the other two.

In this repo, solutions 1, 2, and 3 favor different metrics.

This solution... | optimizes...
--- | ---
solution-1 | Cycles
solution-2 | Size
solution-3 | Activity

Much of the time, 3 solutions won't exist because they're the same.
